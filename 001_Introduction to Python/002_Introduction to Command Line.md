## What is the job of Command Line?

- The command line (or terminal) is a faster and more powerful way to maneuver your operating system than by using a GUI (Graphical User Interface), such as Windows Explorer or Mac Finder.
- In command line we use special keywords to almost everything we can do with a GUI and more.

## Why do we need command line?

- To navigate around different directories.
- Create and remove directories and files.
- To move, copy, paste and rename files.
- To execute Python scripts.

## Understanding OS File Structure

- Operating Systems organize their folders in a hierarchy (a tree) with parents and children, all relative to a base root directory.
- The root directory is denoted by a forward slash (/) in Mac/Linux, while the same is denoted by a backward slash (\) in Windows.
- The home directory is your specific user account directory, it the default directory upon opening your terminal / Powershell / Command Prompt and it is being denoted by tilde (~).
- An absolute path is a way of referring to a file or folder based on its position relative to the root directory.
  - ```/home/defiant-dj04/Documents (in linux)```
  - ```C:\Program Files\Python (in windows)```
- A relative path is a way of referring to a file or folder based on where we are currently in command line.
  - ```Documents/Insurance Policies (in linux)```
  - ```Desktop\Music (in windows)```
